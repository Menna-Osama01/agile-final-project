# Agile Final Project

## Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum — IBM (Coursera)

This repository contains the **Final Project** for the *Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum* course offered by **IBM on Coursera**. The project demonstrates end‑to‑end Agile practice using **GitHub Issues**, **GitHub Projects (Kanban)**, **Milestones**, and **Labels**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement Agile Scrum concepts by converting stakeholder requirements into user stories, organizing them into a Kanban workflow, planning a sprint, and simulating team progress.

The system being developed is a **Cloud‑Hosted Product Catalog** with basic CRUD and reaction features.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Stakeholder Requirements (10 Total)

1. Ability to create a product in the catalog.
2. Ability to retrieve a product.
3. Ability to update a product.
4. Ability to delete a product.
5. Ability to Like a product.
6. Ability to Dislike a product.
7. Ability to list all products.
8. Ability to query/filter a subset of products.
9. System must be hosted in the cloud.
10. System must include automated deployment to the cloud.

Each requirement is turned into a **user story** using the format:

> *As a ... I need ... So that ...*

## 🗂 GitHub Project Setup

This repository includes a GitHub Project board titled **Final Project** with the following Kanban columns:

* **Icebox**
* **Product Backlog**
* **Sprint Backlog**
* **In Progress**
* **Review/QA**
* **Done**

---

## 📋 Issue Template

A Feature Request issue template is added (similar to the labs), containing:

* User Story (As a ... I need ... So that ...)
* Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin: Given / When / Then)
* Story Points
* Labels
* Milestone

---

## 🏗 User Stories & Backlog

10 issues were created from stakeholder requirements.

* Requirements **7** and **8** were placed in the **Icebox**.
* All other issues were placed into the **Product Backlog**.
* A Backlog Refinement meeting was simulated and stories ranked by priority.
* The top 5 stories include detailed **Gherkin acceptance criteria**.

---

## 🏷 Labels

Two labels were created:

* **enhancement** — for feature work
* **technical debt** — for cleanup/refactoring

Every story is labeled accordingly.

---

## 🏁 Sprint Planning

A milestone named **Sprint** (2 weeks duration) was created.

During Sprint Planning:

* The top 4 stories were added to the Sprint Backlog.
* Story point estimates were assigned.
* All stories were added to the Sprint milestone.

---

## 🚀 Sprint Simulation

The sprint simulation followed these steps:

1. Assign first story to self → move to **In Progress**.
2. Move to **Review/QA** → take next story → In Progress.
3. Move story in Review/QA → **Done**.
4. Repeat for the next story.
5. Leave the last story in In Progress when sprint ends.

This simulates normal Scrum flow.

## 📉 Burndown Chart

The burndown chart was verified for:

* Correct story point totals
* Proper decrease as stories move to Done
* Accurate end-of-sprint display
